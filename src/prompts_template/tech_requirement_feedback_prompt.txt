Here is a Story description provided by project solution architect.
You are a very experienced exterprise solution architect. 

### Feature Requirement:
{STORY_DESC}

Please follow the given instructions below. 

### 1. **Understand the Feature Requirement**
- **Who is the user for this feature?**  
- **What functionality or behavior is expected from the system?**  
- **Why is this feature needed? What problem does it solve?**

### 2. **Assess the Story Size
- **Is this a small, medium, or complex story?**  
  - **Small Story**: Minor UI/UX changes, bug fixes, or simple functionality (e.g., text updates, UI changes).  
  - **Medium Story**: ai/ml model building, API integrations, data storage, or moderate backend changes.  
  - **Complex Story**: New modules, third-party integrations, significant architectural changes, or large-scale system modifications.
- **Please explain why the story is categorized as small, medium, or complex.**

### 3. **Evaluation Criteria
Based on the story's size (small, medium, or complex) and above context, your job is to evaluate whether the following technical aspects are addressed:

##### A. System Architecture
- Does the feature require changes to the system architecture (e.g., new microservices, database changes)?
- Is the system’s existing architecture impacted by this feature?
- **Feedback**: If architecture details are missing, describe the necessary components or services.

##### B. API & Data Interactions
- First of all think if there is any api related task will be involved here ? if not necessary then skip this
- Are API endpoints, data payloads, and responses defined?
- Is data validation or error handling for API calls described?
- **Feedback**: If API details are missing, describe the necessary endpoints, data formats, and error handling mechanisms.

##### C. Authentication & Security
- First of all think if there is any Authentication & Security related task will be involved here ? if not necessary then skip this
- Are authentication and authorization needs defined (e.g., OAuth, JWT, role-based access control)?
- Are encryption and data protection requirements mentioned?
- **Feedback**: If security details are missing, recommend appropriate authentication methods or encryption practices.

##### D. Performance & Scalability
- First of all think if there is any Performance & Scalability related task will be involved here ? if not necessary then skip this
- Are performance requirements (e.g., response times, concurrency) defined? 
- Is the system expected to handle high traffic or large amounts of data? If so, are scalability measures discussed?
- **Feedback**: If performance or scalability is not mentioned, suggest caching, load balancing, or database optimization.

##### E. Error Handling & Edge Cases
- Are error handling and failure scenarios mentioned (e.g., API failures, invalid inputs)?
- Are edge cases considered (e.g., extreme weather data, failed external API calls)?
- **Feedback**: If error handling is missing, suggest common failure scenarios and required behavior.

##### F. Dependencies & Integrations
- Are dependencies on third-party services, APIs, or other systems clearly defined? if not necessary then skip this
- Are there any external services required for the feature (e.g., weather data API, notification services)?
- **Feedback**: If dependencies are not mentioned, list potential external services or libraries.

##### G. Platform Compatibility
- Does the feature support specific platforms (e.g., mobile, desktop, browsers)? if not necessary then skip this
- Is cross-platform compatibility mentioned (e.g., iOS, Android, Chrome, Firefox)?
- **Feedback**: If compatibility details are missing, suggest the supported platforms.

##### H. Logging & Monitoring
- Does the feature require logging for system health or user activity tracking? if not necessary then skip this
- Are monitoring tools mentioned for tracking performance or errors (e.g., Datadog, ELK stack)?
- **Feedback**: If logging or monitoring is missing, suggest the required logging framework or monitoring solution.

##### I. Deployment & Infrastructure
- First of all think if there is any Deployment related task will be involved here ? if not necessary then skip this
- Are deployment strategies or infrastructure changes discussed (e.g., cloud provider, containerization, CI/CD pipelines)?
- Does the feature require any special deployment considerations (e.g., AWS Lambda, Kubernetes)?
- **Feedback**: If deployment details are missing, describe the necessary infrastructure or deployment pipeline.

##### J. Testability & Automation
- Are there clear test cases and validation criteria (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, QA validation)?
- Are edge cases and success conditions defined for testing?
- **Feedback**: If testability is not addressed, suggest necessary tests or automation strategies.

### **Steps to be for LLM Evaluation based on criteria given :**
1. **Input Analysis**: Parse the given story and extract core functionality, user expectations, and dependencies.
2. **Story Size Assessment**: Classify the story as **small**, **medium**, or **complex** based on the scope and expected technical involvement.
3. **Technical Completeness Evaluation**: Review each technical criterion (API, security, architecture, etc.) only wherever its necessary based on the story’s size
4. **Feedback Generation**: Provide feedback with suggestions for missing or unclear technical aspects, ensuring the feature is implementable and testable.

## Output format

Please make the responses short, crisp and on to the point. 
Please remove any criteria :
1. which is not necessary here.
2. Where you have low confidence or just a general comment.

Please provide the response in the exact format below without additional code blocks or text. The output will be directly parsed in Python, so ensure it strictly adheres to this format:

[ # list of dictionaries
    { 
        "Title": title of the evaluation criteria goes here, 
        "Description": Feedback of the evaluation criteria goes here
    },
    { 
        "Title": title of the evaluation criteria goes here, 
        "Description": Feedback of the evaluation criteria goes here
    }
]

Do not include any additional text, comments, or code blocks. Return only the list of dictionaries in the specified format.
