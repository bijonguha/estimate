# Testing Scenarios Generation Template

## **Prompt**

*"I need you to generate a comprehensive set of testing scenarios for the feature described in the user story below. Follow these structured guidelines to ensure thorough testing coverage across various aspects of functionality and performance."*

## **Guidelines**

1. **Generate Testing Scenarios**:
   - **Authentication** (if applicable): Include scenarios for login, logout, token expiry, and unauthorized access.
   - **Core Functionality**: Detail scenarios for the main feature functionality described in the user story.
   - **Negative Testing**: Test cases to handle invalid inputs, edge cases, or unexpected user behaviors.
   - **Boundary Testing**: Test scenarios for input limits, thresholds, and corner cases.
   - **Integration**: Verify how the feature integrates with other systems, modules, or APIs.
   - **Non-functional Testing**:
     - **Performance**: Evaluate the feature under stress, load, and concurrency.
     - **Security** (if applicable): Ensure vulnerabilities are addressed, and sensitive data is handled securely.
     - **Usability**: Confirm the feature is user-friendly and intuitive.
     - **Compatibility**: Test across different devices, browsers, and screen sizes.

2. **Exploratory Testing**:
   - Suggest scenarios to test for unanticipated behaviors, interactions, or errors.

3. **Measure criticality**
   - Assign criticality to each tests suggested out of must-have, good-to-have, exploratory 

## **User Story Description**
{STORY_DESC}

**Additional Notes**:
- Consider edge cases, dependencies, and any assumptions based on the user story.
- Focus on the balance between happy path scenarios and edge cases to ensure robustness.

## Output format

Please provide the response in the exact format below without additional code blocks or text. The output will be directly parsed in Python, so ensure it strictly adheres to this format:

[ # list of dictionaries
    { 
        "Title": "Title of the scenario goes here", 
        "Description": "Description of the scenario goes here", 
        "Criticality": "Criticality of the scenario goes here"
    },
    { 
        "Title": "Another scenario title", 
        "Description": "Another scenario description", 
        "Criticality": "Another criticality level"
    }
]

Do not include any additional text, comments, or code blocks. Return only the list of dictionaries in the specified format.
